# CMSC508 Assignment 7 - DDL and SQL Queries
Zac Ching ----- Last Modified 11/11/2023

## Description

The given scenario was that I, as a student, am part of a company of designers and developers trying to pay for school by picking up project work under the tutelage of world famous sensei of Kill-Bill fame. Business apparently has been slow and it is up to us to look for ways to "jumpstart this frankenstein" so the boss comes to us and says "I need a database!" I took it upon myself to sign us all up for a golf tournament that if we win, we can use the prize money towards our projects. This project tracks some golf skills of employees around the office so that for the tournament we'll have a great sense of who can do what. 

This project involves writing a DDL file to populate a database then documenting the database and writing SQL queries in a qmd file. 

## Setup

Run *poetry install* in the terminal to install all of the packages required for the project. Then run *poetry shell* to start the virtual environment so that the connection to the database can be established. From there, the entire DDL file can be ran once through and the output of rendering the qmd file is located in hw7.html.
